# Don't SLAM your head!
Virtual reality is becoming affordable thanks to powerful smartphones and
suitable head-mounts. However, moving in the VR environment still poses a
problem - either the user is seated and uses a joystick, often leading to motion
sickness, or a wide empty space is required to avoid collision with real-world
obstacles. In this thesis, a hybrid visualization of real-world environment data
collected with the smartphone's camera and the virtual environment is developed.
